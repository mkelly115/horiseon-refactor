# horiseon-refactor

The purpose of this project was to refactor and clean up a web page while making it more accesible as well.

To accomplish this, I broke up the large amount of <div> tags within the page into more concise and semantic tags (such as <header>, <section>,<article>). This allows easier CSS changes down the line if needed, as well as makes it easier to read the source and understand what the webpage is trying to accomplish.

All photos were also given alt tags with descriptions to allow people with screen readers or other accesibility devices to understand the content on the page.

## Usage

The webpage is a landing site for the company Horiseon. The company works in Search engine optimization. The goal was to clean up the code while allowing the webpage to visually and functionally remain unchanged. I accomplished this as described above; allowing all links to work correctly on the webpage, visually it remains unchanged, and all alt tags have been added to increase user accesibility.


## Conclusion

Over the course of this project, I gained a stronger understanding of tags and also how to use them correctly. By doing this I was also able to garner a stronger understanding of how CSS interacts with HTML because of the need to make semantic changes without affecting the style of the page. Overall, my understanding was made much stronger by forcing myself to keep styling the same but learning to affect the code and make it cleaner.
